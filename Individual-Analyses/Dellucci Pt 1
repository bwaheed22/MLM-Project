 $$     

## Question 5.

### a. Try to add a random slope for each teacher level predictor (varying at the school level; one by one separately - not all together)

M5<- lmer(math1st ~ housepov + yearstea + mathknow + mathprep + sex + minority + ses + (1|schoolid/classid), data = dat)
summary(M5)
```

### b. Report the models and their fit.

### c. Why is it a bad idea to include a random slope on the housepov effect?

    Response: 

### d. Retry the above models, allowing the slopes to be correlated with the random intercepts (still one by one):

```{r}
# Insert code to fit first model in Q5d model and print summary 
M5d <- lmer(math1st ~ housepov + yearstea + mathknow + mathprep + 
              sex + minority + ses + (mathprep | schoolid) + (1|schoolid/classid), data = dat)
summary(M5d)
```

```{r}
# Insert code to compare models 
anova(M5, M5d, refit = F)
```

    Response: Allowing the mathprep slopes to be correlated with the random intercepts is not justified.

              sex + minority + ses + (yearstea | schoolid) + (1|schoolid/classid), data = dat)

```

```{r}
# Insert code to compare models 
anova(M5, M5e, refit = F)
```
    
    Response: Allowing the yearsteaching slopes to be correlated with the random intercepts is not justified. 

```{r}
# Insert code to fit third model in Q5b model and print summary
M5f <- lmer(math1st ~ housepov + yearstea + mathknow + mathprep + 
              sex + minority + ses + (mathknow | schoolid) + (1|schoolid/classid), data = dat)
summary(M5f)
```

```{r}
# Insert code to compare models 
anova(M5, M5f, refit = F)
```

    Response: Allowing the mathknowledge slopes to be correlated with the random intercepts is not justified. 

### e. Report anything unusual about the variance components (changes that are in a direction you didn’t expect) and any potential explanation for why those changes occured (hint: what did you add to the model?).

    Response:

## Question 6.

### a. Try to add a random slope for each student level predictor (varying at the classroom level; one by one - not all together)

    The model is:   

##  Question 9.

### a. For UMM, write down: V_S, V_C, V_E for the three variance components (simply the estimates)

```{r}
# If you want to look at your UMM insert code here or you can just do this in line 
summary (M6)
```
    
    V_S = 169.45
    
    V_C = 93.89
    
    V_E = 1064.96

### b. For the most complicated (all fixed effects) random INTERCEPTS ONLY model, what are: V_C, V_S, V_E?

### c. By what fraction did these each decrease with the new predictors in the model?

    V_S:(169.45-168.00)/169.45 = 0.01
    
    V_C: (93.89-88.55)/93.89 = 0.06
    
    V_E: (1064.96-1035.12)/1035.12=0.03

# V_S(minority = 0.25)
# Insert code if you want to do the calculations in R 
```

    V_S(minority=0.5) =

```

## Question 12.
### Now consider the model with a random slope in ses & minority.

### a. What are: V_C, V_S(minority=0,ses=0), V_E ? We need to list ‘ses=0, minority=0’ here, or we don’t know how to use the slope variance

```{r}
# If you want to look at your model/variance components insert code here or you can just do this in line  
```

    V_S(sex=0, minority=0) =

    Response: 

### c. Can we make a similar statement about \(\zeta\)~0k~?

    Response: 

### d. If you had a large value for \(\eta\)~0jk~, would you expect a large or small or “any” value for the two random slope terms, \(\zeta\)~1k~ and \(\zeta\)~2k~ for ses and minority?

    Response: 

### e. If you had a large value for \(\zeta\)~0k~, would you expect a large or small or “any” value for the two random slope terms, \(\zeta\)~1k~ and \(\zeta\)~2k~ for ses and minority (discuss each separately)?

    Response:
